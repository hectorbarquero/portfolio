                        <p>Understandably, you might have to do a few quick setup steps. I try to walk you through those as painlessly as possible. Otherwise, once you run the tool, it's quite straightforward.</p>

                        <p>I didn't start this with the intention of making any money. I started this project with a desire to innovate. Though I dabbled with the idea of starting a ko-fi link, and maybe making enough to just fuel my coffee mug, I decided against it. I'd really just love to network with you. If you like my content and want to show me your support, shoot me a message or an invite.</p>

                        <p>I don't really like paywalls, and I certainly dislike instructors and resources who seemingly scam their users into opening their wallets, only to discover a lackluster trade. You came here for free tools, you get free tools. Use these however they suit you. I hope they help.</p>
